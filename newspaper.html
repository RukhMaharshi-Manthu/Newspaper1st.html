        <p>Electric vehicles will be the future of transportation in the country. They have significantly higher energy efficiency when compared to petrol/diesel vehicles and can be more reliable going forward,” he said speaking at the Freedom Talk on ‘Role of Digitisation and ECommerce in Indian Economic Growth’ organised by TANSTIA-FNF Service Centre (TFSC) and Friedrich- Naumann-Stiftung für die Freiheit.</p>
<p>Mr. Jhunjhunwala also noted with the battery prices falling, electric vehicles would be most sought after in the next 5-6 years, and warned that if India waited till that time, it would end up importing electric vehicles instead of oil. Countries like Germany, China and the U.S. are already focusing on electric vehicles, he noted.</p>

        <p>Chengdu Aerospace Science and Technology Microelectronics System Research Institute Company plans to accomplish its lofty goal by creating a satellite that's floating in the sky, mimicking the moon's effect on a city at night. And while it's unclear whether the idea has been supported by officials in Chengdu or the Chinese government, some are concerned about the environmental effects the proposal could have on the area. At a moment in time when cities such as Flagstaff, Arizona, and Ketchum, Idaho, are working to reduce light emissions at night, Chengdu seems, at least with this plan, to be headed in the opposite direction.</p>
        <p>Come 2020, for children living in Chengdu, China, the book Goodnight Moon may have a completely different meaning. Indeed, according to an article in the People’s Daily (a widely distributed online Chinese newspaper), a local company plans to build an artificial moon that, if completed, would be eight times brighter than the actual moon. This sci-fi-like idea may come to fruition to illuminate a distance of up to 50 miles in every direction, effectively replacing all of the city streetlights.</p>
